# Collections in C
## Overview
I have often repeated code with every new project in C due to the fact that things like collections (maps, lists, etc...) are not well provided by various systems. So as a test with GitHub CoPilot, I have decided to try to whip up a basic hash map, list and keyvalue vector (coming) using the new AI copilot and see how it goes.

## Examples
For both lists and maps (unfinished), there is an associated xxxfun file that gets generated with the make.sh file.
